# Idoneals
This is a repository of idoneal proofs. An idoneal is a number that cannot be written as ab + bc + ca for a,b,c as positive distinct integers (0<a<b<c). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idoneal_number for more!



Proofs go one of two ways:

15 (idoneal)

1] 15 > a > b > c > 0.
2] c > 0, b > 1, and a > 2.
3] b + c > 2 and bc > 1.
4] (n / 3) >= a, as if a >= n / 3 then a(b + c) > 3a >= n and ab + ac + bc >= n + bc > n.
a = 3, b = 2, c = 1, ab + bc + ca = 11
a = 4, b = 2, c = 1, ab + bc + ca = 14
a = 4, b = 3, c = 1, ab + bc + ca = 19
a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, ab + bc + ca = 26
a = 5, b = 2, c = 1, ab + bc + ca = 17
a = 5, b = 3, c = 1, ab + bc + ca = 23
a = 5, b = 3, c = 2, ab + bc + ca = 31
a = 5, b = 4, c = any, ab = 20 > 15
a, b, c cannot be positive integer values not listed here.
Thus, 15 is an idoneal number.
There were 8 iterations in this proof.

17 (not idoneal)

17 is NOT an idoneal number; 5x2 + 2x1 + 1x5 = 17
